Background
==========

This simulated data is based off of training study run by David Moreau.
In this study, he examined which of the following programs would be better for improving spatial memory:

1. Aerobic exercise (`aer`) -- basically running on a treadmill.
2. Working memory training (`wm`) -- memorizing locations while doing a distracting task on the computer.
3. Something he called Designed Sport Training (`combo`), meant to combine spatial memory with consistent exercise.

As shown in the diagram below, participants were tested on their spatial memory, then assigned to a program for a month. Afterward, their spatial memory was tested again.

```{r}
wm_dat <- read.csv('training_long.csv')
```

The working memory data set has `r nrow(wm_dat)` rows and `r ncol(wm_dat)` columns. 
Below are the first 5 rows.

```{r}
head(wm_dat, 5)
```

Note that the `session`, `cond`, and `time` columns are factors.

```{r}
str(wm_dat)
```

The levels of each factor are..

* **session**: `r levels(wm_dat$session)`
* **cond**: `r levels(wm_dat$cond)`
* **time**: `r levels(wm_dat$time)`

Questions
=========

1. Using the `table` function, count the number of subjects in each combination of condition and time, using the `cond` and `time` columns.

```{r}

```

2. Make a plot for each combination of condition and time (e.g. cond is "wm" and time is "pre"). There are 6 combinations total (3 conditions x 2 times). Be sure to give it useful labels.

```{r}

```

3. Do a t-test of pre- vs post-test (i.e. `time`). What are the results? (We will ignore the fact that each person was tested at each time for now.)

```{r}

```

4. Conduct a one-way ANOVA of condition for the pre-test group.

```{r}

```

5. Conduct a two-way ANOVA of `cond`ition by `time`.

```{r}

```

Optional
===========

1. Notice that each subject has a pre- and post- test score. How would you make a scatterplot of each person's pre-test score against their post-test score?

```{r}

```
