Background
==========

This simulated data is based off of training study run by David Moreau.
In this study, he examined which of the following programs would be better for improving spatial memory:

1. Aerobic exercise (`aer`) -- basically running on a treadmill.
2. Working memory training (`wm`) -- memorizing locations while doing a distracting task on the computer.
3. Something he called Designed Sport Training (`combo`), meant to combine spatial memory with consistent exercise.

As shown in the diagram below, participants were tested on their spatial memory, then assigned to a program for a month. Afterward, their spatial memory was tested again.

```{r}
wm_dat <- read.csv('training_long.csv')
```

The working memory data set has `r nrow(wm_dat)` rows and `r ncol(wm_dat)` columns. 
Below are the first 5 rows.

```{r}
head(wm_dat, 5)
```

Note that the `session`, `cond`, and `time` columns are factors.

```{r}
str(wm_dat)
```

The levels of each factor are..

* **session**: `r levels(wm_dat$session)`
* **cond**: `r levels(wm_dat$cond)`
* **time**: `r levels(wm_dat$time)`
